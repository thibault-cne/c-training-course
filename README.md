# c-trainning-course

This repo is meant to learn step-by-step the C language. I'll try to create good exercices with some tests so you can figure out what's going wrong on every exercices. I may use `golang` for my tests so you will need to download it. It will be notified when tests are made with `go`.

Feel free to let me know what d you think of those exercices and if you have any idea to improve them, I'll be happy to add some questions/exercices.

I'm not a teacher, I'm currently a student in TELECOM Nancy but I like to make little courses to my friends so I try this C-trainning pack.
